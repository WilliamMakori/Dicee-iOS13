# Dicee

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to help me understand the core programming concepts that form the foundation of most apps I’ll build in the future. By creating this dice app, I’ll learn a lot of essential programming skills while building something fun and useful.

## What I created 

I’m going to make a Las Vegas dice app. I’ll make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking my phone. With this app in my pocket, I’ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!

## What I learned

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* * Learn to use comments to annotate code.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
* Learn about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
